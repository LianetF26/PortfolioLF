			<img src="mifhdbn.jpg" class="auth-image">
			<p>Hello. My name is Lianet Fundora. I am 14 years old and was born in Havana City, Cuba. I came to Miami when i was just four years old. I have gone yo Cuba twice after we left. The first time I was six. The second was when I was eight. This November I am going to Cuba again! Since most of my father's uncles and aunts live there. He wants to see them before they die.  </p>
			<p>I currently go to Coral Gables High. I really like Gables. They have plenty of wonderful teachers that care about their students well being. </p>
